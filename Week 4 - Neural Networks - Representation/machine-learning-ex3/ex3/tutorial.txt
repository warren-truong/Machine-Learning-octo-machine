% all_theta is a matrix, where there is a row for each of the trained
% thetas. In the exercise example, there are 10 rows, of 401 elements each.
% You know this because that's how all_theta was initialized in line 15 of
% the script template.
% 
% (note that the submit grader's test case doesn't have 401 elements or 10
% rows - your function must work for any size data set - so use the
% "num_labels" variable).
% 
% Each call to fmincg() returns a theta vector. Be sure you use the lambda
% value provided in the function header.
% 
% You then need to copy that vector into a row of all_theta.
% 
% The oneVsAll.m script template contains several Hints and a code example
% to guide your work.
% 
% Type these commands in your workspace to see how to copy a vector into a
% matrix:
% 
% Q = zeros(5,3)      % create a test matrix of all-zeros v = [1 2 3]'
% % create a column vector Q(2,:) = v          % copy v into the 2nd row of
% Q
% 
% The syntax "(2,:)" means "use all columns of the 2nd row".
