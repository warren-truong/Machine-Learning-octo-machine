function p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label for a trained one-vs-all classifier. The labels 
%are in the range 1..K, where K = size(all_theta, 1). 
%  p = PREDICTONEVSALL(all_theta, X) will return a vector of predictions
%  for each example in the matrix X. Note that X contains the examples in
%  rows. all_theta is a matrix where the i-th row is a trained logistic
%  regression theta vector for the i-th class. You should set p to a vector
%  of values from 1..K (e.g., p = [1; 3; 1; 2] predicts classes 1, 3, 1, 2
%  for 4 examples) 

m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(all_theta, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% Add ones to the X data matrix
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned logistic regression parameters (one-vs-all).
%               You should set p to a vector of predictions (from 1 to
%               num_labels).
%
% Hint: This code can be done all vectorized using the max function.
%       In particular, the max function can also return the index of the 
%       max element, for more information see 'help max'. If your examples 
%       are in rows, then, you can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max 
%       for each row.

% The code you add to predictOneVsAll.m can be as little as two lines:
% one line to calculate the sigmoid() of the product of X and
% all_theta. X is (m x n), and all_theta is (num_labels x n), so you'll
% need a transposition to get a result of (m x num_labels) 

% one line to return the classifier which has the max value. The size will be (m x
% 1). Use the "help max" command in your workspace to learn how the
% max() function returns two values. Note that your function must
% return the predictions as a column vector - size (m x 1). If you
% return a row vector, the script will not compute the accuracy
% correctly.

% Generate values of A
A = X*all_theta';

% Go through the values 1:m for each x in X and pick out the MAX in
% order to vectorize the equation
for i = 1:m,
    [x, ix] = max(A(i,:));
    p(i) = ix;
